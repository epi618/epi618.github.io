<p>The geocentric model of the Universe placed the Earth at the center of the Universe. The heliocentric model placed the Sun at the center.</p>
<p>The Earth is one of the eight planets orbiting the Sun.This Solar System lies on the outer edge of the Milky Way galaxy. The Universe contains hundreds of billions of galaxies.</p>
<p>The red shift of light distant galaxies led to the expanding Universe theory. Most astronomers agree that expansion began after the Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago.</p>
<p>The first atoms (hydrogen and helium) of the Universe developed within minutes of the Big Bang. These atoms formed vast gas clouds,called nebulae.</p>
<p>Gravity caused clumps of gas in the nebulae to coalesce into flattened disks with bulbous centers. The center of each disk became so dense and hot that fusion reactions began and they became the true stars.</p>
<p>The Earth, and the life forms on it, contains elements that could have been produced only during the life cycle of stars. Thus, we are all made of stardust.</p>
<p>Planets developed from the rings of gas and dust surrounding protostars. These condensed into planetesimals that then clumped together to form protoplanets, and finally true planets. Inner rings became the terrestrial planets. Outer rings grew into gas-giant planets.</p>
<p>The Moon formed from debris ejected when a protoplanet collided with the Earth in the young Solar System.</p>
<p>A planet assumes a near-spherical shape when it becomes so soft that gravity can smooth out irregularities.</p>
<p>The Earth has a magnetic field that shields it from solar wind and cosmic rays.</p>
<p>A layer of gas surrounds the Earth. This atmosphere(78% $N_2$,21% $O_2$, and 1% other gases) can be subdivided into layers. Air pressure decreases with increasing elevation.</p>
<p>The surface of the Earth can be divided into land (30%) and ocean (70%).</p>
<p>The Earth consists of organic chemicals, minerals, glasses, rocks, metals, melts, and volatiles, Most rocks on Earth contain silica ($SiO_2$). We distinguish among various major rock types based on the proportion of silica.</p>
<p>The Earth&rsquo;s interior can be divided into three distinct layers: the very thin crust, the rocky mantle, and the metallic core.</p>
<p>Pressure and temperature both increase with depth in the Earth. The rate at which temperature increases as depth increases is the geothermal gradient.</p>
<p>The crust is a thin that varies in thickness from 7-10km(beneath the oceans)to 25-70km(beneath the continents), Oceanic crust is mafic in composition,whereas average upper continental crust is felsic to intermediate. The mantle is composed of ultramafic rock. The core is made of iron alloy.</p>
<p>Studies of earthquake waves reveal that the mantle can be subdivided into an upper mantle(including the transition zone)and a lower mantle. The core can bes subdivided into the liquid outer core and a solid inner core. Circulation of the outer core produces the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field.</p>
<p>The crust plus the upper part of the mantle constitute the lithosphere, a rigid shell. The lithosphere lies over the asthenosphere, mantle that can flow.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-way-the-earth-works-plate-tectonics">2 The Way the Earth Works: Plate Tectonics</h2>
<p>Alfred Wegener proposed that continents had once been joined together to form a single huge supercontinent(pangaea) and had subsequently drifted apart. This idea is the continental drift hypothesis.</p>
<p>Wegener drew from several different sources of data to support his hypothesis:(1)the correlation of coastlines; (2)the distribution of late Paleozoic glaciers; (3)the distribution of late Paleozoic climatic belts; (4)the distribution of fossil species; and (5) correlation of distinctive rock assemblages now on opposite sides of the ocean.</p>
<p>Rocks retain a record of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field that existed at the time the rocks formed. This record is called paleomagnetism. By measuring paleomagnetism in successively older rocks, geologists discovered apparent polar-wander paths.</p>
<p>Apparent polar-wander paths are different for different continents, because continents move with respect to each other, while the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic poles remain roughly fixed.</p>
<p>Around 1960, Harry Hess proposed the hypothesis of sea-floor spreading. According to this hypothesis, new sea floor forms at mid-ocean ridges, then spreads symmetrically away from the ridge axis. Eventually, the ocean floor sinks back into the mantle at deep-ocean trenches.</p>
<p>Geologists documented that the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field reverses polarity every now and then. The record of reversals is called the magnetic-reversal chronology.</p>
<p>A proof of sea-floor spreading came from the interpretation of marine magnetic anomalies and from drilling studies which proved that sea floor gets progressively away from a mid-ocean ridge.</p>
<p>The lithosphere is broken into discrete plates that move relative to each other. Continental drift and sea-floor spreading are manifestations of plate movement.</p>
<p>Most earthquakes and volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, the interiors of plates remain relatively rigid and intact.</p>
<p>There are three type of plate boundaries-divergent,convergent,and transform-distinguished from each other by the movement the plate on one side of te boundary makes relative to the plate on the other side.</p>
<p>Divergent boundaries are marked by mid-ocean ridges. At divergent boundaries,sea-floor spreading produces new oceanic lithosphere.</p>
<p>Convergent boundaries are marked by deep-ocean trenches and volcanoes arcs. At convergent boundaries,oceanic lithosphere subducts beneath an overriding plate.</p>
<p>Transform boundaries are marked by large faults at which one plate slides sideways past another. No new plate forms and no old plate is consumed at a transform boundary.</p>
<p>Hot spots are place where volcanism occurs at an isolated volcano. As a plate moves over the hos spot, tje volcano moves off and dies, and a new volcano forms over the hot spot. Hot spots may be caused by mantle plumes.</p>
<p>A large continent can split into two smaller ones by the process of rifting. During rifting, continental lithosphere stretches and thins. If it finally breaks apart, a new mid-ocean ridge forms and sea-floor spreading begins.</p>
<p>Convergent plate boundaries cease to exist when a buoyant piece of crust(a continent or an island arc) moves into the subduction zone. When that happens,collision occurs.</p>
<p>Ridge-push force and slab-pull force contribute to driving plate motions, Plates move at rates of about 1 to 15 cm per year. Modern satellite measurements can detect these motions.</p>
<h2 id="3-patterns-in-natureminerals">3 Patterns in Nature:Minerals</h2>
<p>Minerals are naturally occurring, solid substances, formed by geologic process, with a definable chemical composition and an internal structure characterized by an orderly arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystalline lattice. Most minerals are inorganic.</p>
<p>Biogenic minerals are produced by organisms. The minerals in shells are an example of biomineralization.</p>
<p>In the crystalline lattice of minerals, atoms occur in a specific pattern&ndash;one of nature&rsquo;s finest examples of ordering.</p>
<p>Minerals can form by te solidification of a melt, precipitation from a water solution, diffusion through a solid, the metabolism of organisms, and precipitation from a gas.</p>
<p>About 4000 different type of minerals are known, each with a name and distinctive physical properties(such as color,streak, luster, hardness, specific gravity,crystal habit, cleavage, magnetism, and reactivity with acid).</p>
<p>The unique physical properties of a mineral reflect its chemical composition and crystal structure,By observing these physical properties,you can identify minerals.</p>
<p>The most convenient way to classify minerals is to group them according to their chemical composition. Mineral classes include silicates, oxides, sulfides, sulfates, halides, carbonates, and native metals.</p>
<p>Silicate minerals are the most common minerals on Earth. The silicon-oxygen tetrahedron, a silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms, serves as the fundamental building block of silicate minerals.</p>
<p>Groups of silicate minerals are distinguished from each other by the ways in which the silicon-oxygen tetrahedra that constitute them are linked.</p>
<p>Gemstone are minerals known for their beauty and rarity. The facets on cut gems used in jewelry are made by grinding and polishing the stones with a faceting machine.</p>
<h2 id="4-up-from-the-infernomagma-and-igneous-rocks">4 Up from the Inferno:Magma and Igneous Rocks</h2>
<p>Magma is liquid rock(melt) under the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Lava is melt that has erupted from a volcano at the Earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>Magma forms when hot rock in the Earth partially melts. This process occurs only under certain circumstance&mdash;when the pressure decrease, when volatiles are added to hot rock, and when heat is transferred into the crust by magma rising from the mantle into the crust.</p>
<p>Magma occurs in a range of compositions:felsic(silicic), intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic. The composition of magma reflects the original composition of the rock from which the magma formed and the way the magma evolves.</p>
<p>Magma rises from depth because of its buoyancy and because of pressure caused by the weight of overlying rock.</p>
<p>Magma viscosity depends on composition. Felsic magma is more viscous thant mafic magma.</p>
<p>The rate at which intrusive magma cools depends on the depth at which it intrudes, the size and shape of the magma body, and whether circulating groundwater is present. The cooling time influences the texture of an igneous rock.</p>
<p>Extrusive igneous rocks form from lave that erupts out of a volcano. Intrusive igneous rocks develop from magma that freezes inside the Earth.</p>
<p>Lave may solidify to form flows, or it may explode into the air to form ash.</p>
<p>Intrusive igneous rocks form when magma intrudes into pre-existing rock below Earth&rsquo;s surface. Blob-shaped intrusions are called plutons. Tabular intrusions that cut across layering are dikes, and those that form parallel to layering are sills. Huge intrusions, made up of plutons, are know as batholiths.</p>
<p>Igneous rocks are classified according to texture and composition.</p>
<p>The origin of igneous rocks can readily be understood in the context of plate tectonics. Magma forms at continental or island volcanic arcs along convergent margins, mostly because of the addition of volatiles to the asthenosphere above the subducting slab. Igneous rocks form at hot spots, owing to the decompression melting of a rising mantle plume. Igneous rocks form aat rifts as a result of decompression melting of the asthenosphere below the thinning lithosphere or heat transfer from mantle melts into crustal rocks, Igneous rocks form along mid-ocean ridges because of decompression melting of the rising asthenosphere.</p>
<h2 id="5-the-wrath-of-vulcan-volcanic-eruptions">5 The Wrath of Vulcan: Volcanic Eruptions</h2>
<p>Volcanoes are vents at which molten rock(lava), pyroclastic debris, gas, and aerosols erupt at the Earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>The characteristic if a lava flow depend on its viscosity, which in turn depends on its temperature and composition.</p>
<p>Basaltic lave can flow great distances. Pahoehoe flows have smooth, ropy surfaces, whereas a&rsquo;a&rsquo; flows have rough, rubbly surfaces. Andesitic and rhyolitic lava flows tend to pile into mounds at the vent.</p>
<p>Pyroclastic debris includes powder-sized ash, marble-sized lapilli, and apple- to refrigerator-sized blocks and bombs. Some falls from the air, whereas some forms pyroclastic flows.</p>
<p>Eruptions may occur at a volcano&rsquo;s summit or from fissures on its flanks. The summit of an erupting volcano may collapse to form bowl-shaped depression called a caldera.</p>
<p>A volcano&rsquo;s shape depends on the type of eruption. Shield volcanoes are broad, gentle domes, Cinder cones are steep sided, symmetrical hills, Composite volcanoes (stratovolcanoes) can become quite large and consist of alternating layers of pyroclastic debris and lava.</p>
<p>The type of eruption depends on the lava&rsquo;s viscosity and gas content. Effusive eruptions produce flows, whereas explosive eruptions produce pyroclastic debris.</p>
<p>Different kinds of volcanoes form in different geologic settings as defined by plate tectonics theory.</p>
<p>Volcanic eruptions pose many hazards:lava flows overrun roads and towns, ash falls blanket the landscape, pyroclastic flows incinerate towns and fields, landslides and lahars bury the land surface,earthquakes topple structures and rupture dams, tsunamis wash away coastal towns, and invisible gases suffocate people and animals.</p>
<p>Eruptions can be predicted by earthquake activity, changes in heat flow, changes in shape of the volcano, and the emission of gas and steam.</p>
<p>We can minimize the consequences of an eruption by avoiding construction in danger zones.</p>
<p>Immense flood basalts cover portions of te Moon, The largest known volcano, Olympus Mons, tower over the surface of Mars. Satellites have documented evidence for eruption on moons of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<h2 id="6-page-of-earths-pastsedimentary-rocks">6 Page of Earth&rsquo;s Past:Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
<p>Geologists recognize four major classes of sedimentary rocks. Clastic rocks form from cemented-together grains that were first produced by weathering, then were transported, deposited, and lithified. Biochemical rocks develop from the shells of organisms. Organic rocks consist of plant debris or of altered plankton remains. Chemical rocks precipitate directly from water.</p>
<p>Sedimentary structures include bedding, cross bedding, graded bedding, ripple marks, dunes, and mud cracks. They serve as clues to depositional settings.</p>
<p>Biochemical and organic rocks form from materials produced by living organisms.</p>
<p>Limestone consists dominantly of calcite, chert forms from silica, coal from carbon, shale from clay, and sandstone from quartz grains.</p>
<p>Evaporites consist of minerals precipitated from water.</p>
<p>Glaciers, streams, alluvial fans, deserts, rivers, lakes ,deltas, beaches, shallow seas, and deep seas each accumulate a different ,distinctive assemblage of sedimentary strata.</p>
<p>Thick piles of sedimentary rocks accumulate in sedimentary basins, regions where the lithosphere subsides.</p>
<p>Transgression occur when sea level rises and the coastline migrates inland. Regressions occur when sea level falls and the coastline migrates seaward.</p>
<p>Diagenesis involves processes leading to lithification and processes that alter sedimentary rock at temperatures lower than those that cause metamorphism.</p>
<h2 id="7-metamorphism-a-process-of-change">7 Metamorphism: A Process of Change</h2>
<p>Metamorphism refers to changes in a rock that result in the formation of a metamorphic mineral assemblage, and/or metamorphic texture, in response to change in temperature and/or pressure, to the application of differential stress, and to interaction with hydrothermal fluids(hot water solutions).</p>
<p>Metamorphism involves recrystallization, phase changes, metamorphic reactions(neocrystallization), pressure solution, and/or plastic deformation. If hydrothermal fluids bring in or remove elements, we say that metasomatism has occurred.</p>
<p>Metamorphic foliation can be defined either by preferred mineral orientation (aligned inequant crystals) or by compositional banding. Preferred mineral orientation develops where differential stress causes the compression and shearing of a rock so that its inequant grains align parallel with each other.</p>
<p>Geologists separate metamorphic rocks into two classes, foliated rocks and nonfoliated rocks.</p>
<p>The class of foliated rocks includes slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss. The class of nonfoliated rocks includes hornfels, quartzite, and marble, Migmatite is a mixture of igneous and metamorphic rock.</p>
<p>Rocks formed under relatively low temperatures are known as low-grade rocks, whereas those formed under high temperatures are known hig-grade rocks. Intermediate-grade rocks develop between these two extremes. Different metamorphic mineral assemblages form at different grades.</p>
<p>Geologist track te distribution of different grades of rock by looking for index minerals. Isograds indicate the location at which index minerals fist appear. A metamorphic zone is the region between two isograds.</p>
<p>A metamorphic facies is a group of metamorphic mineral assemblages that develop under a specified range of temperature and pressure conditions.</p>
<p>Thermal (contact) metamorphism occurs in an aureole surrounding an igneous intrusion. Burial metamorphism occurs at depth in a sedimentary basin. Dynamically metamorphosed rocks form along faults. Dynamothermal (regional) metamorphism results when rocks undergo heating and shearing during mountain building. Hydrothermal metamorphism can take place duo to the circulation of hot water in oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges. Shock metamorphism happens during the impact of a meteorite.</p>
<p>We find belts of metamorphic rock in mountain ranges. Blueschist forms in accretionary prisms. Shields expose broad areas of Precambrian metamorphic rocks.</p>
<h2 id="8-a-violent-pulseearthquakes">8 A Violent Pulse:Earthquakes</h2>
<p>Earthquakes are episodes of ground shaking. Earthquake activity is called seismicity.</p>
<p>Most earthquakes happen when rock slips during faulting. The place where rock breaks and earthquake energy s released is called the hypocenter, and the point on the ground directly above the focus is the epicenter.</p>
<p>Active faults are faults on which movement is likely. Inactive faults ceased being active long ago. Displacement on active faults that intersect the ground surface may yield a fault scarp.</p>
<p>During fault formation, rock elastically bends, then ruptures. When this happens,the rock vibrates, and this generates an earthquake.</p>
<p>Faults exhibit stick-slip behavior, in that they move in sudden increments. Most earthquakes happen when stress overcomes friction on a preexisting fault, and the fault slips again.</p>
<p>Earthquake energy travel in the form of seismic waves, Body waves, which pass through the interior of the Earth, include P-waves and S-waves. Surface waves, which pass along the surface of the Earth, include R-waves and L-waves.</p>
<p>We can detect earthquake waves by using a seismometer. Seismograms, records of earthquakes, demonstrate that different earthquake waves at different velocities. Using the different between P-wave and S-wave arrival times, seismologists can pinpoint the epicenter location.</p>
<p>The Mercalli Intensity scale is based primarily on documenting the damage caused by an earthquake. Magnitude scales are based on measuring the amount of ground motion, as indicated by a seismogram.</p>
<p>An $M_w$8 earthquake yields about 10 times as much ground motion as $M_w$7 earthquake, and 32 times as much energy.</p>
<p>Most Earthquakes occur in seismic belts, of which the majority lie along plate boundaries. Intraplate earthquakes happen in the interior of plates.</p>
<p>Earthquake damage results fro ground shaking, landslides, sediment liquefaction, fire, and tsunamis.</p>
<p>Seismologists predict that earthquakes are ore likely in seismic zones thant elsewhere, and can determine the recurrence interval for great earthquakes. But it may never be possible to pinpoint the exact time and place at which an earthquake will happen.</p>
<p>Earthquake hazards can be reduced with better construction practices and zoning, and by educating people about what to do during an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id="9-cragscracks-and-crumplescrustal-deformation-and-mountain-building">9 Crags,Cracks, and Crumples:Crustal Deformation and Mountain Building</h2>
<p>Mountains occur in linear ranges called orogens. An orogen forms during an orogeny, or mountain-building event.</p>
<p>Mountain building causes rocks to bend, break, shorten, stretch, and shear. Because of such deformation, rocks can change their location, orientation, and shape.</p>
<p>During brittle deformation, rocks break into pieces. During ductile deformation, rocks change shape without breaking.</p>
<p>Rocks undergo three kinds of stress: compression, tension, and shear. Strain refers to the way rocks change shape when subjected to a stress.</p>
<p>Deformation results in the development of geologic structures.</p>
<p>Joints are natural cracks in rocks, formed in response to tension under brittle conditions. Veins develop when minerals precipitate out of water passing through cracks.</p>
<p>Faults are fractures on which there has been shear. Geologists distinguish among normal, reverse, strike-slip, and oblique-slip faults.</p>
<p>Folds are curved layers of rocks. Anticlines are Arch-like, synclines are trough-like, monoclines resemble the shape of a carpet draped over a stair step, basins are shaped like a bowl, and domes are shaped like an overturned bowl.</p>
<p>Tectonic foliation forms when grains flatten, rotate, or grow so that they align parallel with one another.</p>
<p>Uplift in mountains, over broad regions, is controlled by the isostasy, meaning that the elevation of the Earth&rsquo;s surface reflects the level at which lithosphere naturally floats.</p>
<p>Large collisional mountain ranges are underlain by buoyant roots and contain folds, faults, and foliations.</p>
<p>With modern GPS technology, it is now possible to measure the slow shortening and uplift of mountains.</p>
<p>Once uplifted, mountains are sculpted by erosion. When crust thickens during mountain building, the deep crust eventually becomes weak, leading to orogenic collapse.</p>
<p>Mountain belts formed by convergent-margin tectonism may incorporate accreted terranes.</p>
<p>Cratons are the old, relatively stable parts of continental crust. They include shields and platforms. Broad regional domes and basins form in platform areas.</p>
